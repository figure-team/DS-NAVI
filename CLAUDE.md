# Understand Anything

## Project Overview
An open-source tool combining LLM intelligence + static analysis to produce interactive dashboards for understanding codebases.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 22 (developed on v24)
- pnpm >= 10 (pinned via `packageManager` field in root `package.json`)

## Architecture
- **Monorepo** with pnpm workspaces
- **understand-anything-plugin/** — Claude Code plugin containing all source code:
  - **packages/core** — Shared analysis engine (types, persistence, tree-sitter, search, schema, tours, plugins)
  - **packages/dashboard** — React + TypeScript web dashboard (React Flow, Zustand, TailwindCSS v4)
  - **src/** — Skill TypeScript source for `/understand-chat`, `/understand-diff`, `/understand-explain`, `/understand-onboard`
  - **skills/** — Skill definitions (`/understand`, `/understand-dashboard`, etc.)
  - **agents/** — Agent definitions (project-scanner, file-analyzer, architecture-analyzer, tour-builder, graph-reviewer)

## Dashboard (FRONT_REDESIGN — docs/ktds/FRONT_REDESIGN_DESIGN.md)
- **DS-NAVI light theme by default** (`ds-navi-light` preset): DS-APM palette — light backgrounds (#f4f5f7/#fcfcfd/#fff), red accent (#d81b2c), Pretendard typography. Dark presets remain selectable; mode-dependent component tokens (node/layer/diff/status/method colors) switch via `themes/theme-engine.ts` MODE_EXTRAS
- **react-router SPA** — URL is the single source of truth for navigation (no `viewMode` in the store). Shell = left NavRail + TopBar (`src/app/shell/`), section pages in `src/app/pages/`: 홈 `/`, 도메인 `/domains/:domainId?flow=`, 구조 `/structure?node=&level=&overlay=diff|impact|risk`, 추적표 `/rtm`, 산출물 `/deliverables`, 위키 `/wiki`, 지식그래프 `/knowledge`, 데이터 `/data`, 변경·영향 `/change`, 프로그램 `/programs`, 품질·위험 `/quality`, 보고서 `/report`, 정책서 `/policy`. 신설 6메뉴 데이터는 분석 프로젝트 `.spec/map/*.json`을 dev 엔드포인트(vite.config.ts SPEC_MAP_ENDPOINTS) + sync:demo로 서빙. Deep links, refresh, and back/forward all work
- Token gate is a root-layout guard (`src/app/Root.tsx`): `?token=` → sessionStorage → stripped from URL; deep-link paths survive the gate. Central token/dataUrl helpers in `src/shared/api/client.ts`
- Sidebar tabs (structure/knowledge/wiki workbench): `Info` (ProjectOverview → NodeInfo when selected → LearnPanel in Learn persona) and `Files` (FileExplorer)
- Code viewer: global shell layer (slide-up + modal), prism theme switches with mode (vsDark↔github). Source fetched from dev server `/file-content.json`, gated by access token + graph-derived path allowlist
- Schema validation on graph load with error banner
- QA affordances: `?onboard=skip|force` (onboarding), `?theme=<presetId>` (one-shot preset override, not persisted)

## Agent Pipeline
- Agents write intermediate results to `.understand-anything/intermediate/` on disk (not returned to context)
- Agent model field is omitted from frontmatter so each platform falls back to its configured default — `inherit` was a Claude Code-only keyword that opencode (and similar tools) treated as a literal model id and rejected with `ProviderModelNotFoundError` (see #167)
- `/understand` auto-triggers `/understand-dashboard` after completion
- Intermediate files cleaned up after graph assembly

## Key Commands
- `pnpm install` — Install all dependencies
- `pnpm --filter @understand-anything/core build` — Build the core package
- `pnpm --filter @understand-anything/core test` — Run core tests
- `pnpm --filter @understand-anything/skill build` — Build the plugin package
- `pnpm test` — Run all tests (skill tests live at repo-root `tests/skill/`, picked up by root `vitest.config.ts`)
- `pnpm --filter @understand-anything/dashboard build` — Build the dashboard
- `pnpm dev:dashboard` — Start dashboard dev server
- `pnpm lint` — Run ESLint across the project

## Conventions
- TypeScript strict mode everywhere
- Vitest for testing
- ESM modules (`"type": "module"`)
- Knowledge graph JSON lives in `.understand-anything/` directory of analyzed projects
- Core uses subpath exports (`./search`, `./types`, `./schema`) to avoid pulling Node.js modules into browser

## Gotchas
- **tree-sitter**: Uses `web-tree-sitter` (WASM) instead of native `tree-sitter` — native bindings fail on darwin/arm64 + Node 24
- **Dashboard imports**: Dashboard must only import from core's browser-safe subpath exports (`./search`, `./types`, `./schema`), never the main entry point which pulls in Node.js modules

## Scripts
- `scripts/generate-large-graph.mjs` — Generates a fake knowledge graph for performance testing (e.g. large-graph layout). Writes to `.understand-anything/knowledge-graph.json`. Usage: `node scripts/generate-large-graph.mjs [nodeCount]` (default: 3000 nodes). Not part of the production pipeline.

## Versioning
When pushing to remote, bump the version in **all five** of these files (keep them in sync):
- `understand-anything-plugin/package.json` → `"version"` field
- `understand-anything-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` → `"version"` field
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` → `"version"` field
- `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` → `"version"` field
- `.copilot-plugin/plugin.json` → `"version"` field

Note: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` does **not** carry a version — the `plugins[]` entry only supports `name` and `source`, and adding other fields causes marketplace schema validation failures.

## Testing Local Plugin Changes

Claude Code caches installed plugins at `~/.claude/plugins/cache/understand-anything/understand-anything/<version>/`. Symlinks don't work because Claude's Search/Glob tools can't follow them. To test local changes:

1. **Build the packages:**
   ```bash
   pnpm --filter @understand-anything/core build
   pnpm --filter @understand-anything/skill build
   ```

2. **Find the installed version** (must match what the marketplace currently serves):
   ```bash
   ls ~/.claude/plugins/cache/understand-anything/understand-anything/
   ```

3. **Copy your local plugin into the cache**, replacing `<VERSION>` with the version from step 2:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/cache/understand-anything/understand-anything/<VERSION>
   cp -R ./understand-anything-plugin ~/.claude/plugins/cache/understand-anything/understand-anything/<VERSION>
   ```

4. **Start a fresh Claude Code session** (existing sessions cache the old prompts in context).

5. **Run `/understand --full`** in the target project to verify.

**Re-sync after further changes:**
```bash
pnpm --filter @understand-anything/core build && \
cp -R ./understand-anything-plugin/* ~/.claude/plugins/cache/understand-anything/understand-anything/<VERSION>/
```

**To revert to upstream:** Uninstall and reinstall the plugin from the marketplace — it repopulates the cache from the upstream repo.
